**OBJECTIVE -**

Finite state machines (FSMs) are at the heart of most digital design. The basic idea of an FSM is to store a sequence of different unique states and transition between them depending on the values of the inputs and the current state of the machine. Finite state machines can be used to model problems in many fields including mathematics, artificial intelligence, games, and linguistics .

**KEY ACTIVITIES -**

 1. Specification: Define FSM functionality, states, inputs, and outputs.
 2. State Diagram: Draw state diagrams for transitions.
3. Coding: Write state, transition, and output logic in Verilog/VHDL.
4. Simulation: Create testbenches to verify FSM behavior.
5. Synthesis: Optimize design for performance and area.
6. Implementation: Implement on FPGA/ASIC and test.
7. Debugging: Identify and fix issues, refine design.

**TECHNOLOGY USED -**

1. Verilog/VHDL: HDL for digital systems.
2. ModelSim: Simulation.
3. Synopsys Design Compiler: Synthesis.
4. Xilinx/Altera: FPGA/CPLD.
5. Cadence/Mentor Graphics: EDA tools.
6. RTL Design: Data flow and control.
7. UVM: Verification.
8. PrimeTime: Timing analysis.
9. Power Analysis Tools: Power optimization.
10. Logic Analyzers: Debugging.
